React Native Todo Challenge
</h1>

## ðŸ¤“ Tech Stuff
Built using Expo, this app implements react-navigation, DateTimePicker for handling dates, React Hooks for functional components. Data is handled using CRUD cycles and uses very basic Redux for state management.

A hamburger menu was also included, which provides a second method to navigate through the app. Also in the menu, some items will open the native browser and route the user to my linkedIn and github pages. 

Sharing is also another feature, in case you feel like telling others how exciting it was to do your taxes and buy groceries.
